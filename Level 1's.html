<h><b> Level 1's </b></h>

<p>Getting level 1 cerified was one of the biggest achivements of my life. Becoming a level 1 certified instructor means that U.S. Sailing nationally recognizes you as a certified sailor, who is allowed to teach anyone the fundamentals of sailing. </p>

<p> To become a certified instructor, you must pass a 4 day, 40 hour course. This course includes 3 written exams, along with on the water leaership, and teamwork skills.

<p>The written exams tested our knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motorboat parts and safety</li>
<li>Fundamentals of Sailing</li>
<li>On the water safety, and sailboat rescue procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>On all of these tests, you must score an 80 or above to pass the course.</p>

<p>The on the water tests included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A capsize drill</li>
<li>A follow the leader type drill, where you were in a motorboat and led the class around the harbor</li>
<li>And finally, you had to come up with a drill on your own, and lead the rest of the class while out on the water</li>

<p>Along with all these tests and drills, there were presentations we gave, and public speeches we had to make. We also had to know some basic knot tying including: a figure 8, a bowline, and how to tie off a boat to a dock.</p>
